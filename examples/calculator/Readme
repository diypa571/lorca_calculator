Lorca is simple to learn... using javascript and html and css, create your desktop to applications for Linux, Windows and Mac
This example, is about creating a simple calculator using only javascript and the bootstrap 5.2 framework...


Iam using Linux, to run it your Linux Machine,

Make sure you have golang already installed... if not use this command

sudo apt install golang-go

master
cd calculator 
go run ./


sudo bash build-linux.sh
